# Things I Wish I Knew Three Years ago

# (_or_ things I knew but could have put to better use . . .)

---

# Outline 


## Tech tools

- Manage literature <!-- Papers/Mendeley/Zotero, + RSS + people/topic alerts from GoogleScholar/PubMed--> 
- Build a web presence <!--Create a personal website (Wordpress.com, maybe Github), consider social media (twitter in science)-->
- Set up your computer for science
- Get help

--

## Mental tools

- None of this is a substitute for thinking
- Thinking is hard
- Give yourself time and space


---

# Mental

Slides for this section, and most ideas, given in the in-person version were
shamelessly stolen from Julia Baum @baumlab. Go [read the whole
thing](baumlab.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/4/4/12445281/baum_2013_mentalresilience_lowresforposting.pdf). If
I ask for and receive permission I will include them on the public version too.

The key points: 

* read Martin A Schwartz (2008) [The importance of stupidity in scientific research](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18492790)
* remember research is hard, creative work and give yourself mental space
* develop good work habits for the age of distraction
* be kind to yourself and others

# Be the best scientist you can be 

## know your stuff

## focus on discovery 

_accept stupidity_ and embrace creativity -- give yourself time to think and keep an open mind

## be persistent

rejection is part of science

# Technical

* all of this is FYI
* if you use/like a system, don't switch
* ask your advisor and lab what _they_ use!!

# Literature Management, Sharing, and Discovery

* Automatic citation generation from pdfs
* Citation database
* Integration with Word, Open/LibreOffice, BibTeX
* Endnote can integrate with word, free [while at UCD](http://www.lib.ucdavis.edu/dept/instruc/research/endnote/) but can you take it with you?

# Mendeley: share your references

# Discover new literature

* journal RSS + some RSS reader OR table of contents alerts + email
*  people/topic alerts from [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/) or [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/guide/howto/receive-search-results/)
* blogs and preprint servers (e.g. [Haldane's Sieve](http://haldanessieve.org/) started by Graham Coop )
* Twitter ...

# Set up a web presence!! 

---

* build a website, it's easy now -- focus on the content not the tools
* even if you have one, migrate to a new content management system!
* twitter can help (but not mandatory)

---

* wordpress
* weebly
* jekyll, pelican, etc (perhaps with hosting via github pages)

# Set your computer up to do science

* key tools: R (R studio), text editor (depends on OS) 
--

* recommended: a _package manager_ on mac (eg homebrew, fink), command line (developer tools on Mac), git 
--

* ask your friends and chort what tools they use!
--

* google for other ideas and tutorials: [scientific computing on mac top hit](http://scottlab.ucsc.edu/~wgscott/xtal/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) it's [harder on windows](http://faustusnotes.wordpress.com/2012/04/21/the-end-of-scientific-computing-with-windows/) and easier on linux but can be done

# Data Sharing and sync/Backup


* Synchronize folders on your computer to other computers, the web and other users

--

* Useful for sharing with others or yourself notes, pdf library, documents 

--

* [box](http://cloud.ucdavis.edu/cloud_storage.html) offers 50GB storage to UCD affiliates (but less useful for integrating with third party software than dropbox/ google drive ...)


--

* dropbox/google drive offer 5GB and 10GB respectively free     
--

* rsync (if you have a server or want to use e.g. github)

* keep track of changed files
* more below in social coding
* ask Vince ;)

# Collaboration

## writing

* google docs <!--.right[![tmp](images/google-docs-logo.jpg)]-->
* microsoft word track changes and a chain of emails

--

## code

* dropbox
* social coding tools (more below) which _can_ be used for writing too with LaTeX or [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#images)
* private SCM repository on a server

---


layout: true

# Collaborative text editing and coding

* use 'social coding' tools to collaborate
* get strong version control for free

# Github

* Collaborative coding
* Free for open source projects AND [for students](https://education.github.com/) limited nuimber of private repositories
* Uses the Git distributed version control software

---

layout: false

# Q & A

* stackoverflow
* crossvalidated
* lists, e.g. R-sig-mixed

# Local Resources for tech help / education

* R help: [Davis R Users Group [D-RUG] ](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/davis-rug)
* Stats classes: Ecology Grad Student Association [stats course guide](http://egsa.ucdavis.edu/resources/stats/#courses)
* Workshops: software carpentry (occasional), CPB (occasional, sometimes relevant)

# Questions, followup 

* @jaimedash
* jashander@ucdavis.edu

## thanks

* firsties for tip on 50GB Box, reminding me about EndNote and Word track changes
